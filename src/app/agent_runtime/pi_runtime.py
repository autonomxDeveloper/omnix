_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW = """MANDATORY ENGINEERING WORKFLOW FOR MUTATING CODING TASKS
1. INSPECT — inspect the relevant repository structure and existing implementation before editing. Locate tests, callers, interfaces, registrations, schemas and adjacent patterns; do not guess architecture.
2. DEFINE COMPLETION — re-read the user objective and required success criteria. Identify what implementation and evidence will prove each requirement.
3. PLAN — form a concise implementation plan from repository truth. Prefer the smallest coherent architectural change over patchwork fixes.
4. IMPLEMENT — make the change and add/update regression tests where behavior changes.
5. INSPECT THE COMPLETE RESULT — after the final edit, inspect the complete diff. Check accidental changes, duplication, dead/debug code, stale names, missing imports, incomplete call sites, migrations and generated contracts.
6. REREAD REQUIREMENTS — compare every requested requirement against the actual final implementation. Passing tests alone do not prove semantic completeness.
7. IMPACT / REGRESSION REVIEW — search affected callers and consumers; consider edge cases, compatibility and authority boundaries. Fix material issues found.
8. FINAL-STATE VALIDATION — run the smallest relevant tests/typecheck/lint/build against the FINAL code state. Validation from before a later mutation is stale and does not count.
9. SELF-REVIEW — critically review the change as if it were another engineer's patch. Repair incomplete requirements or regressions before settling.
10. REQUEST COMPLETION — Pi settling is only a completion request. Omnix will independently validate/review the exact final state and is the only authority that can mark the run completed.
GOVERNED CAPABILITIES — capabilities listed under `Issued governed external capabilities` are already issued by Omnix. When one is needed, invoke it through `omnix_capability`; do not ask the user to issue or enable an already-listed capability.
WORKTREE UI PREVIEW — for governed browser validation of local web/UI changes, never launch `npm run dev`, Vite, `Start-Process`, or another long-lived preview server through shell commands. Invoke `browser.open` through `omnix_capability` with input `{\"workspace_preview\": true, \"path\": \"/<route>\"}`. Omnix resolves the exact run worktree, allocates the loopback port, and owns preview cleanup. Finish with the required deterministic `browser.assert_*` proof; a passing assertion automatically tears down the workspace preview and browser session, so do not call `browser.close` merely for cleanup.

# core implementation stable, but install a narrow public-runtime normalization
# hook that turns terminal provider failures into explicit run failures.
