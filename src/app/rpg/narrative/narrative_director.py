"""Narrative Director — STEP 2 of RPG Design Implementation.

This module implements the NarrativeDirector, which converts raw world
events into NarrativeEvent objects with importance and emotional scoring.

Purpose:
    Serve as the bridge between the simulation layer (world events)
    and the narrative layer (storytelling). The director decides
    which events are narratively significant.

Architecture:
    World Events → NarrativeDirector → NarrativeEvents → Focus Selection

Usage:
    director = NarrativeDirector()
    narrative_events = director.convert_events(world_events)
    focus = director.select_focus_events(narrative_events)

Design Compliance:
    - STEP 2: Narrative Director from rpg-design.txt
    - Does NOT generate text — only scores and filters events
    - Importance/emotion scoring is deterministic (no LLM needed)
