"""Narrative module — Story arcs, narrative events, and narrative generation.

This module implements the narrative layer from the RPG design spec:
- NarrativeEvent: Structured event representation with importance scoring
- NarrativeDirector: Converts world events to narrative events
- SceneManager: Tracks active scenes and scene context
- NarrativeGenerator: Turns events into narrative prose
- StoryArc: Story arc management
- TIER 5 Experience Orchestration:
  - AIDirector: Controls narrative tension and event shaping
  - DialogueEngine: Belief-driven dialogue generation
  - PacingController: Controls narrative length and density

Architecture:
    World Events → NarrativeDirector → NarrativeEvents → Focus Selection

                                   AIDirector → Tension Shaping
                                   DialogueEngine → Character Dialogue
                                   PacingController → Output Control
