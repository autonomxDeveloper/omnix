"""Dialogue Engine — Goal-Driven Dialogue System.

TIER 5: Experience Orchestration — System 2 of 3

Purpose:
    Generates NPC dialogue based on beliefs, relationships, emotional state,
    and dialogue goals. NPCs pursue outcomes through dialogue rather than
    merely reacting — they intimidate, persuade, deceive, threaten, or reveal
    information based on their current goals.

Architecture:
    MemoryManager (beliefs/goals) + Speaker + Target → Intent → Goal → Tactic → Line

The DialogueEngine first determines the speaker's goal, selects a
rhetorical tactic based on that goal, and generates dialogue that
matches both the tactic and emotional tone.

Usage:
    engine = DialogueEngine(memory_manager)
    line = engine.generate_dialogue("guard", "player")
    # "The guard watches the player suspiciously."

Design Compliance:
    - TIER 5 from rpg-design.txt: Belief-Driven Dialogue System
    - Integrates with NarrativeGenerator for dialogue integration
    - Uses BeliefSystem for relationship-aware dialogue
    - NPCs act with intention, not just react
