"""Story Arc Manager — Persistent long-term narrative goals.

This module implements CRITICAL PATCH 2 from the RPG design specification:
"DIRECTOR HAS NO LONG-TERM INTENT"

The Problem: Director plans per turn, scenes exist, but there are no
persistent goals or story arcs. Without arcs, the system produces moments,
not stories.

The Solution: StoryArc and StoryArcManager that track long-term narrative
goals across multiple scenes and turns.

Architecture:
    StoryArc(goal, entities, progress) →
        Update from events →
        Progress toward completion

Usage:
    manager = StoryArcManager()
    arc = manager.create_arc("Defeat the Dark Lord", ["player", "dark_lord"])
    manager.update_arcs(events)
    summary = manager.get_summary()  # For Director prompt injection

Key Features:
    - Persistent goals that survive across turns/scenes
    - Progress tracking from events
    - Arc completion triggers story consequences
    - Multiple concurrent arcs supported
    - Arc dependency (one arc unlocks another)
    - Summary for Director prompt injection
