"""Narrative Generator — STEP 4 of RPG Design Implementation.

This module implements the NarrativeGenerator, which uses an LLM (or
templates) to convert structured narrative events into immersive prose.

Purpose:
    Generate vivid, emotionally appropriate narrative text from
    structured events and scene context.

Architecture:
    NarrativeEvents + SceneContext → LLM/Template → Narrative Text

Usage:
    generator = NarrativeGenerator(llm=my_llm)
    narrative = generator.generate(narrative_events, scene_context)

Design Compliance:
    - STEP 4: Narrative Generator from rpg-design.txt
    - Wraps any LLM callable with signature: llm(prompt: str) -> str
    - Falls back to template generation if no LLM is provided
