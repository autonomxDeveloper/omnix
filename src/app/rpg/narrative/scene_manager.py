"""Scene Engine — STEP 3 of RPG Design Implementation.

This module implements the SceneManager, which tracks the active scene
and accumulates events for coherent narration.

Purpose:
    Group related events into scenes and track scene context (location,
    participants, recent events) so the narrator can generate cohesive text.

Architecture:
    Narrative Events → SceneManager → Scene Context → Story Generation

Usage:
    sm = SceneManager()
    sm.update_scene(narrative_events)
    context = sm.get_scene_context()
    
Design Compliance:
    - STEP 3: Scene Engine from rpg-design.txt
    - Does NOT generate text — only tracks scene state
    - Keeps memory bounded by limiting stored events
