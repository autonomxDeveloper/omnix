"""Narrative Surface Engine — Tier 14: Player Experience & Perception Layer.

This module implements the player-facing narrative layer that surfaces
internal simulation depth into compelling player-perceived narrative.

Problem:
    The simulation has incredible internal depth (emotions, memory, factions),
    but none of it is visible to the player.
    
    Result: Player sees bland, repetitive events despite complex underlying systems.

Solution:
    NarrativeSurfaceEngine translates internal game state into rich,
    player-facing narrative output with:
    - Headline generation (attention-grabbing summaries)
    - Emotional context framing
    - Memory echo callbacks to past events
    - Relationship-aware descriptions

Usage:
    engine = NarrativeSurfaceEngine()
    narration = engine.narrate(event, world_state, player)

Architecture:
    Input: Internal event dict + world state + player profile
    Output: {
        "headline": "Tension Rises Between Alice and Bob",
        "description": "Their alliance shows signs of fracture.",
        "emotional_context": "Alice seems distrustful.",
        "memory_echo": "This mirrors the conflict from years ago.",
    }

Design Rules:
    - Every surfaced event should feel narratively distinct
    - Emotional context should reflect actual simulation state
    - Memory echoes should connect to real past events
    - Headlines should be attention-grabbing, not mechanical
