"""Pacing Controller — Narrative Beat Control.

TIER 5: Experience Orchestration — System 3 of 3

Purpose:
    Controls narrative length, density, and structure based on tension level.
    Intense scenes get shorter, punchier narration (fast pace, action beats).
    Calm scenes get longer, more descriptive narration (slow pace, reflection beats).
    This creates a dynamic reading experience that matches the story's mood.

Architecture:
    Narrative Text + Tension Level + Events -> Adjusted Text with Beat Control

The PacingController takes generated narration and adjusts its structure
based on the current tension level from the AI Director:
- High tension: action beats only, remove fluff
- Mid tension: balanced mix of action and description
- Low tension: include reflective beats and atmosphere

Usage:
    pacing = PacingController()
    text = pacing.adjust(narrative_text, tension=0.8)  # Fast pace, action-focused
    text = pacing.adjust(narrative_text, tension=0.2)  # Slow pace, reflective

Design Compliance:
    - TIER 5 from rpg-design.txt: Narrative Pacing Controller
    - Integrates with PlayerLoop for final narration adjustment
    - Works with AIDirector tension for dynamic pacing
