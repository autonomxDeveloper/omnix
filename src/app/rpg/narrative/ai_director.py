"""AI Director — Tension Engine for Narrative Orchestration.

TIER 5: Experience Orchestration — System 1 of 3

Purpose:
    Controls narrative tension and event shaping over time.
    The AI Director ensures the story has build-up, climax, and calm periods
    rather than a flat, monotonous sequence of events.

Architecture:
    The director maintains an internal tension value (0.0 to 1.0) that
    oscillates over time using a sine wave. This tension value determines:
    - Which events are prioritized (high tension → combat/danger, low tension → calm/dialogue)
    - How many events are selected for narration
    - The overall narrative pacing

Usage:
    director = AIDirector()
    director.update()  # Call each tick
    filtered = director.filter_events(narrative_events)

Design Compliance:
    - TIER 5 from rpg-design.txt: AI Director (Tension Engine)
    - Integrates with PlayerLoop to shape event selection
    - Works with PacingController for output length control
