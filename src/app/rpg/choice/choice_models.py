"""Choice data models for the Irreversible Consequence Engine.

This module defines data structures for player choices and their lifecycle:
- PlayerChoice: A decision point with options presented to the player
- ConsequenceRecord: A recorded consequence of a player's choice
- TimelineEntry: A permanent entry in the world's history timeline

These models support the design principle that player choices create
irreversible world mutations and belief shifts.
