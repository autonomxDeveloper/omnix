"""PHASE 2 — REPLAY ENGINE (PATCHED + PHASE 2.5 ENHANCEMENTS)

Provides deterministic replay of game state using event history.

Core capabilities:
- Replay full session from events
- Replay up to specific tick
- Enable time-travel debugging
- Foundation for save/load system
- Hybrid replay (snapshot + events) for performance

PHASE 2 FIXES (rpg-design.txt):
- Fix #1 (event_bus.py): emit(replay=True) prevents history duplication
- Fix #2: ReplayEngine no longer calls load_history() — history builds naturally
- Fix #3: Replay advances loop._tick_count to prevent tick collision
- Fix #4: Removed load_history() from replay path entirely
- Fix #5: Events are dispatched to system handle_event() consumers so
          replay actually reconstructs game state instead of just logging

PHASE 2.5 ENHANCEMENTS:
- Deterministic event ordering by (tick, timestamp, event_id)
- Hybrid replay: Load from nearest snapshot + replay events after
- Support for branching timelines via root_event_id

DESIGN RULES:
- Replay MUST use fresh systems, not reused ones (factory pattern)
- Replay MUST advance tick to prevent future tick collisions
- Replay MUST dispatch to systems so state is actually reconstructed
- Events are sorted deterministically for reproducible replay

class ReplayEngine:
    """Replays event streams to reconstruct game state.

    This engine provides deterministic replay capability by feeding
    recorded events back into a fresh game loop instance. This enables:
    - Full session replay from event history
    - Tick-based time-travel debugging
    - Save/load via event logs (no full state serialization needed)
    - Foundation for branching timelines

    PHASE 2 FIX #2: Requires a factory that returns a COMPLETELY FRESH
    GameLoop with new system instances. Reusing systems (world, npc_system,
    etc.) causes state leaks and breaks determinism.

    Example:
        def fresh_loop_factory():

                intent_parser=IntentParser(),    # NEW instance

                event_bus=EventBus(),            # NEW instance

        PHASE 2.5 — DETERMINISTIC ORDERING + HYBRID REPLAY:
        - Events are sorted by (tick, timestamp, event_id) for deterministic ordering
        - Nearest snapshot is loaded first if available, events before snapshot are skipped
        - This prevents O(n) replay from tick 0 for large event histories

        PHASE 3 — BRANCH SELECTION:
        - If branch_leaf_id is provided, only events on that branch are replayed
        - Branch is reconstructed by following parent links from leaf to root
        - This enables "what if I did something different?" time-travel

        PHASE 5.1.5 — FIX #3: Deterministic replay mode.
        When mode="deterministic", the replay engine:
        - Disables LLM calls (prevents non-deterministic AI responses)
        - Freezes time (prevents timestamp-based randomness)
        - Uses recorded outputs only (pure event sourcing)

        Args:
            events: Full event history to replay.
            up_to_tick: Optional tick cutoff. If provided, only events
                       with tick <= up_to_tick will be replayed.
            branch_leaf_id: Optional event ID of the leaf node in a branch.
                           If provided, only events on the path from root
                           to this leaf will be replayed, enabling branching
                           timeline exploration.
            mode: Replay mode. "normal" (default) or "deterministic".
                 Deterministic mode disables LLM, freezes time, and uses
                 recorded outputs for pure deterministic replay.
