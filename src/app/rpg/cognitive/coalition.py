"""Coalition System — Tier 11 Layer 5: Coordinated NPC Behavior.

This module implements Layer 5 of Tier 11: the Coalition System that
enables NPCs to form temporary alliances and coordinate their actions
toward shared goals.

Purpose:
    Allow NPCs to form coalitions based on:
    - Shared interests / common enemies
    - Reputation and trust levels
    - Strategic necessity (weak factions band together)
    - Faction alignment

The Problem:
    - NPCs act independently even when cooperation makes sense
    - No coordination between allied factions
    - Weak NPCs get eliminated by stronger ones without resistance
    - No emergent political behavior

The Solution:
    CoalitionSystem tracks and manages:
    - Coalition formation (who is allied with whom)
    - Coordination execution (who does what in the coalition)
    - Coalition dissolution (when interests diverge)
    - Coalition benefits (strength in numbers)

Usage:
    coalition_sys = CoalitionSystem(identity_system)
    
    # Find potential coalition partners
    partners = coalition_sys.find_partners("small_faction", world_state)
    
    # Form coalition
    coalition = coalition_sys.form_coalition("small_faction", partners)
    
    # Get coordinated action
    action = coalition_sys.get_coordinated_action("small_faction", "attack", world_state)

Architecture:
    Coalition:
    ├── Members: List of faction/character IDs
    ├── Leader: Coordinator faction/character
    ├── Shared Goal: What the coalition is working toward
    ├── Trust Levels: Internal trust between members
    └── Duration: How long the coalition has existed

Coalition Actions:
    - coordinated_attack: Multiple attackers with role assignment
    - coordinated_defense: Shared defense pact
    - coordinated_negotiation: Joint diplomatic approach
    - resource_sharing: Pooling resources between allies

Design Rules:
    - Coalitions form based on reputation and shared enemies
    - Weaker factions seek coalitions more aggressively
    - Coalitions dissolve if trust drops too low or goal is achieved
    - No coalition exceeds MAX_COALITION_SIZE members
