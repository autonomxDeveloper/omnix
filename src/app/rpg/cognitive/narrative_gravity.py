"""Narrative Gravity — Tier 12: Narrative Convergence Engine.

This module implements Tier 12's Narrative Convergence Engine that forces
storyline convergence, payoff, and resolution. It prevents the narrative
from fragmenting into too many threads that lose player attention.

Problem:
    With agents acting, coalitions forming, rumors spreading, and learning
    adapting, there's no narrative convergence:
    - Too many concurrent threads
    - No resolution of story arcs
    - Player loses clarity and engagement
    
    Result: narrative fragmentation after ~100 ticks

Solution:
    NarrativeGravity applies "gravity" to pull storylines toward:
    1. Convergence (reducing active threads)
    2. Payoff (resolving setup threads)
    3. Resolution (closing completed arcs)

Usage:
    gravity = NarrativeGravity()
    
    # Score events for importance
    score = gravity.score_event(event, characters, world_state)
    
    # Filter active storylines
    focused = gravity.apply_gravity(active_storylines, max_active=3)
    
    # Check if storyline should conclude
    if gravity.should_conclude(storyline, current_tick):
        resolution = gravity.generate_resolution(storyline)

Architecture:
    Event Importance Scoring:
    importance = (
        character_importance * 0.3
        + coalition_size * 0.2
        + player_involvement * 0.3
        + narrative_progress * 0.2
    )
    
    Scene Focus System:
    - Only render top N events
    - Others become background noise
    - Player-centric filtering

Design Rules:
    - Maximum 3 active storylines at once
    - Events score 0.0-1.0 importance
    - Player-involved events get priority boost
    - Old unresolved threads get resolution pressure
    - Background events don't disappear, just deprioritized
