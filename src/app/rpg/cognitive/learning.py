"""Learning System — Tier 11 Layer 6: Lightweight Adaptive Behavior.

This module implements Layer 6 of Tier 11: the Learning System that tracks
action outcomes and adapts NPC behavior based on past successes and
failures. This is NOT machine learning — it's simple outcome tracking
with behavioral adaptation.

Purpose:
    Track action outcomes and adapt NPC behavior based on:
    - Recent success/failure rates
    - Action effectiveness trends
    - Pattern recognition (repeated failures)

The Problem:
    - NPCs repeat failing strategies indefinitely
    - No behavioral adaptation from experience
    - No persistence of learned behaviors
    - Repetitive patterns feel mechanical

The Solution:
    LearningSystem tracks:
    - Action history with outcomes (success/failure)
    - Recent failure counts per action type
    - Behavioral adaptation when failures exceed threshold

Usage:
    learning = LearningSystem()
    
    # Record action outcome
    learning.record_outcome("npc_bob", "attack", success=False)
    
    # Get adapted intent (may change if failures detected)
    adapted = learning.adapt_intent("npc_bob", original_intent)
    
    # Check if NPC should change strategy
    if learning.should_change_strategy("npc_bob", "attack"):
        new_intent = learning.suggest_alternative("npc_bob", "attack")

Architecture:
    Action History:
    ├── Character ID → Actions list
    │   ├── Action type
    │   ├── Outcome (success/failure)
    │   └── Tick when performed
    └── Analysis
        ├── Failure counts by action type
        ├── Recent window (last N actions)
        └── Adaptation triggers

Design Rules:
    - Track last N actions per character (not entire history)
    - Failure threshold triggers adaptation
    - Adaptation = reduce priority or suggest alternative
    - No ML, no complex learning algorithms
    - Lightweight and deterministic
