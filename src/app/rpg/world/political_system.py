"""Political System - TIER 8: World Complexity Layer.

This module implements PART 3 of Tier 8 from the RPG design specification:
the Political System.

Purpose:
    Simulate faction leadership dynamics, instability, and coups. Leaders
    affect faction behavior, and political upheaval creates story
    opportunities that feel unscripted.

The Problem:
    - Factions have no leadership or decision-making
    - No political instability or change mechanism
    - Faction behavior is static regardless of circumstances
    - No coup or rebellion mechanics

The Solution:
    PoliticalSystem tracks faction leaders, monitors faction stability
    (based on morale and resources), and triggers leadership changes
    (coups) when instability exceeds threshold. Leader changes affect
    faction goals and relations.

Architecture:
    Leader:
        - name, traits, faction_id
        
    PoliticalSystem:
        leaders: {faction_id -> Leader}
        
        update(faction_system):
            1. Check instability per faction (1.0 - morale)
            2. If instability > 0.7 → possible coup
            3. Install new leader with different goals
            4. Return political events

Key Features:
    - Leader assignment per faction
    - Instability tracking (1.0 - morale)
    - Coup probability (10% when instability > 0.7)
    - Leader traits affect faction behavior
    - Political event generation for quest generation
