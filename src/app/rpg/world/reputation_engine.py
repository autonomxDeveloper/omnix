"""Reputation Engine — TIER 7: Faction Simulation + Reputation Economy.

This module implements PART 2 of Tier 7 from the RPG design specification:
the Reputation Engine.

Purpose:
    Track the player's standing with each faction and convert actions into
    faction reactions. Reputation drives NPC behavior, plot access, and
    world state changes.

The Problem:
    - Player actions don't affect faction relationships
    - No sense of "standing" with groups
    - Same NPCs treat player the same regardless of history
    - No reputation-based access to content

The Solution:
    ReputationEngine tracks per-faction reputation scores that change
    based on player actions. These scores determine faction attitudes
    (ally/neutral/hostile) which feed into NPC behavior and plot
    availability.

Usage:
    rep = ReputationEngine()
    
    # Player helps a faction
    rep.apply_action("help_mages", {"faction_rep": {"mages_guild": 0.3}})
    
    # Check attitude
    attitude = rep.get_attitude("mages_guild")  # "ally" if > 0.5
    
    # Faction access check
    if rep.get("mages_guild") > 0.6:
        unlock_inner_circle_arc()

Architecture:
    Player Action → Effect Dict (faction_rep changes)
         ↓
    ReputationEngine.apply_action()
         ↓
    Per-faction reputation updated (-1.0 to 1.0)
         ↓
    Attitude Classification (hostile/neutral/ally)
         ↓
    NPC Behavior Modification + Plot Access Control

Key Features:
    - Per-faction reputation tracking
    - Action → reputation mapping via effect dicts
    - Attitude classification (hostile, neutral, friendly, ally)
    - Reputation thresholds for content unlocking
    - Relationship decay over time (optional)
