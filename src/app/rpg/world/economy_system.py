"""Economy Simulation System - TIER 8: World Complexity Layer.

This module implements PART 1 of Tier 8 from the RPG design specification:
the Economy Simulation.

Purpose:
    Turn economic pressure into emergent story. Supply and demand per
    region create scarcity, trade routes create opportunity for faction
    conflict, and price fluctuations create urgency for quests.

The Problem:
    - World economy is static and abstract
    - No shortage-driven quest opportunities
    - Faction conflicts lack economic motivation
    - Player has no economic impact on world

The Solution:
    EconomySystem tracks supply/demand per good per location, simulates
    trade flow between markets, and generates economic events (shortages,
    trade spikes, shortages) that feed into the quest generator and
    faction conflict engine.

Architecture:
    Market (per location):
        goods: {good -> {supply, demand, price}}
        
    EconomySystem:
        markets: {location_id -> Market}
        trade_routes: [(src, dst, good)]
        
        update():
            1. Update local prices based on supply/demand
            2. Simulate trade flow along routes
            3. Return economic events

Key Features:
    - Supply/demand price simulation
    - Trade route flow detection
    - Shortage event generation
    - Market state tracking
