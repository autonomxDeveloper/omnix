"""Faction Simulation System — TIER 7: Faction Simulation + Reputation Economy.

This module implements PART 1 of Tier 7 from the RPG design specification:
the Faction Simulation Engine.

Purpose:
    Turn the system from "story reacting to player" into "world evolving
    with or without the player." Factions fight, form alliances, shift
    power balances, and create emergent story arcs independent of player action.

The Problem:
    - World is static backdrop until player interacts
    - NPCs don't have their own agenda
    - No emergent conflicts or alliances
    - Story feels scripted, not alive

The Solution:
    FactionSystem simulates faction resources, morale, relations, and
    territorial influence over time. When relations drop below threshold,
    conflicts emerge. These conflicts feed into the Plot Engine as
    emergent story arcs.

Usage:
    fs = FactionSystem()
    fs.add_faction(Faction("mages_guild", "Mages Guild"))
    fs.add_faction("warriors_hall", "Warriors Hall")
    fs.factions["mages_guild"].relations["warriors_hall"] = -0.8
    
    events = fs.update()  # Advances simulation, returns emergent events

Architecture:
    Faction State (power, resources, morale, relations, influence)
         ↓
    Resource Update (power-driven resource growth)
         ↓
    Morale Update (resource-driven morale shifts)
         ↓
    Conflict Detection (negative relations → conflict events)
         ↓
    Plot Engine (conflicts become war arcs)

Key Features:
    - Faction power/resources/morale simulation
    - Inter-faction relationship tracking
    - Automatic conflict detection when relations < -0.6
    - Territorial influence mapping
    - Event generation for plot engine consumption
