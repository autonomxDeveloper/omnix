"""Agent Brain — Decision-making for autonomous NPCs.

This module implements the Agent Brain from TIER 10 of the RPG design spec.

Purpose:
    Transform NPC beliefs, goals, and memory into intentions that drive
    autonomous behavior. The Agent Brain evaluates each NPC's internal
    state against the current world state to decide what type of action
    the NPC should take next.

The Problem:
    - NPCs are reactive only, no proactive behavior
    - No goal-driven decision-making
    - NPCs don't adapt to changing world conditions

The Solution:
    AgentBrain evaluates:
        goals + beliefs + world_state → next intention
    Intentions are high-level action types that the Planner converts
    into concrete multi-step plans.

Usage:
    brain = AgentBrain()
    intention = brain.decide(npc_character, world_state)

Architecture:
    Character State (goals, beliefs, memory)
         ↓
    Goal Priority Evaluation
         ↓
    Intention Selection
         ↓
    Output: intention dict for Planner

Design Rules:
    - Deterministic logic (no LLM in core loop)
    - Goal priority: survival > power > social > idle
    - Intentions are abstract, not concrete actions
    - Beliefs modulate goal selection
