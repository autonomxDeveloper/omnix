"""Agent Scheduler — NPC turn scheduling for autonomous agent system.

This module implements the Agent Scheduler from TIER 10 of the RPG design spec.

Purpose:
    Decide which NPCs act each simulation tick, how often, and in
    what order. This prevents CPU explosion by limiting active NPCs
    per tick while ensuring all NPCs get regular opportunities to act.

The Problem:
    - Every NPC acting every tick is computationally expensive
    - Some NPCs (powerful, relevant) should act more often
    - No prioritization of important characters
    - Random order can miss critical NPC actions

The Solution:
    AgentScheduler selects a subset of NPCs to act each tick based on:
    - Character priority/power (more important = act more often)
    - Randomness for variety
    - Configurable max_per_tick to control CPU usage

Usage:
    scheduler = AgentScheduler(max_per_tick=5)
    active_ids = scheduler.select_agents(characters, world_state)
    for cid in active_ids:
        char = characters[cid]
        # Run agent brain, planner, executor

class AgentScheduler:

    The scheduler manages NPC turn order and throttling. Not every
    NPC acts every tick — the scheduler selects the most important
    NPCs while maintaining some randomness for emergent behavior.
    
    Selection Algorithm:
    1. Calculate priority score for each character
       - Base: random shuffle
       - Bonus: power/importance factor
    2. Select top max_per_tick characters
    3. Return selected character IDs
