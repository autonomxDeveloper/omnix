"""Phase 3D — Incident Engine + Policy System.

Deterministic incident spawning and faction policy reactions derived from
simulation state transitions.

Rules
-----
* Incident spawning
    - Thread incidents: If a thread becomes critical → spawn thread_crisis
    - Location incidents: If a location becomes hot → spawn location_flashpoint
    - Faction incidents: If a faction becomes strained → spawn faction_instability

* Policy reactions
    - If faction is watchful → spawn faction_alert
    - If faction is strained → spawn faction_crackdown
    - If faction pressure drops to stable from higher → spawn faction_relief

All rules are fully deterministic and bounded.
