"""Player Experience Module — Tier 14: Player Experience & Perception Layer.

This module implements Tier 14's core systems that transform the underlying
simulation into a compelling player experience:

1. Narrative Surfacing Engine - Decides what the player sees, compresses
   complexity into clarity
2. Attention Director - Highlights important events, hides noise
3. Emotional Feedback Loop - Shows consequences emotionally, not just logically
4. Memory Echo System - Callbacks to past arcs, creates "story continuity feeling"
5. Player Identity Model - World adapts to player's style and values

Design Principles:
    - Simulation depth should be perceived, not just exist
    - What the player sees is more important than what exists
    - Emotional resonance trumps mechanical accuracy
    - Player identity shapes world response

Usage:
    engine = PlayerExperienceEngine()
    surfaced = engine.surface_event(event, context)
    
Architecture:
    PlayerExperienceEngine:
    - NarrativeSurfacer: Compresses complex events into player-facing narrative
    - AttentionDirector: Filters and prioritizes what player notices
    - EmotionalFeedbackLoop: Translates mechanical changes into emotional impact
    - MemoryEchoSystem: Generates callbacks to past events
    - PlayerIdentityModel: Tracks and applies player preferences
