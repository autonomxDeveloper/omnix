"""Player Agency System — Long-term consequence tracking.

This module implements PART 2 of Tier 6 (Narrative Intelligence Systems)
from the RPG design specification: the Agency System.

Purpose:
    Track player choices and their long-term consequences so the world
    remembers what the player did. This transforms moment-to-moment gameplay
    into meaningful narrative arcs where actions have weight.

The Problem:
    - Player acts, world reacts immediately
    - But consequences are short-lived
    - No visible branching or remembered impact
    - Player feels like choices don't truly matter

The Solution:
    AgencySystem records every meaningful choice, extracts consequences,
    stores them as persistent world flags, and provides query interfaces
    for other systems (NPC behavior, plot engine, etc.) to react.

Usage:
    agency = AgencySystem()
    result = agency.record("killed_guard", {"guards_hostile": True})
    
    # Later in NPC behavior:
    if world.agency.get_flag("guards_hostile"):
        npc.hostility += 0.5

Architecture:
    Player Action → AgencySystem.record() → 
        Extract consequences → Store flags → 
        World systems read flags for behavior
    
Key Features:
    - Choice history tracking
    - World flag management
    - Effect extraction from outcomes
    - Flag query interface for NPC/plot systems
    - Branch tracking
    - Consequence chaining

    The AgencySystem is the core of player agency in the RPG. It records
    every meaningful player decision, extracts the consequences, and stores

    choices actually mattered."
