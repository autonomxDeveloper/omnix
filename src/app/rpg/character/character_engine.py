"""Character Engine (Beliefs + Goals) — TIER 9: Narrative Intelligence Layer.

This module implements the Character Engine from Tier 9 of the RPG design specification.

Purpose:
    Track individual characters with beliefs, goals, and memory. Characters
    react to world events and evolve their beliefs based on experiences.

The Problem:
    - Characters are static data containers
    - No belief system or goal-driven behavior
    - Characters don't remember past events
    - No personal growth or trauma from events

The Solution:
    CharacterEngine manages Character objects that have:
    - Dynamic beliefs about factions, players, and the world
    - Personal goals that drive behavior
    - Memory of significant events
    - Belief updates triggered by world events

Usage:
    engine = CharacterEngine()
    char = engine.get_or_create("mage_leader", "Archmage Aldric")
    char.add_belief("mages_guild", 0.8)
    char.add_goal("protect the library")
    
    engine.update_from_events(world_events)

Architecture:
    Character Model (beliefs, goals, memory)
         ↓
    Event Processing (belief updates from events)
         ↓
    Goal Generation (events create new goals)
         ↓
    Memory Storage (significant events stored)
